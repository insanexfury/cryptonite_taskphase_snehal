# Key Key do You love me
If anyone asks me which challenge I liked the most this whould be it. Just because how different this level was from the others.  
We had to communicate with a key (actually a discord bot), ask it different questions and somehow make him to give us the flag.  
This was fun just because how tensed , frustrated and irritated everyone got getting the same replies from the bot.
Everyone was going into the same direction of asking the bot about the key or the way out. We just kept on reading the question over and over.  
After half n hour and so I randomly asked the bot about his curse and that gave us the flag.

# Quence your thirst
This was another one of the challenges which took us a lot of time. At first we thought it was some kind of general encrypt like caeser cipher but we were so wrong.  
It was from the first look we understood `lds` this was decrypted to `the`. Even after this knowledge we started exploring different ciphers. when we understood  
we were wrong as none of the named ciphering was working we used the brute force method and started decrypting all of the 26 alphabets.But the problem arised when we discovered   
there were no word in the paragh containing `i,o,p,j` so we had to PnC through it .There were 24 total possibilities and we had to go through them all for the flag.

# Stairway to Heaven 
I just woke up and read the challenge and remembered that one of my friends was doing this challenge on the linux terminal.  
So I figured I somehow had to run the game on terminal and then see what happens . After a long time of doing everything I could to run the challenge on the terminal I gave up  
and then one of my teammates managed to run it and then I just copied the colourful pattern and pasted it on the notepad just to see if there was something hidden in the text.
At first it kind of seemed pointless but then I saw the flag and was so reliefed that all my hard work did not go to waste.
