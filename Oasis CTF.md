# Key Key do You love me
If anyone asks me which challenge I liked the most this whould be it. Just because how different this level was from the others.  
We had to communicate with a key (actually a discord bot), ask it different questions and somehow make him to give us the flag.  
This was fun just because how tensed , frustrated and irritated everyone got getting the same replies from the bot.
Everyone was going into the same direction of asking the bot about the key or the way out. We just kept on reading the question over and over.  
After half n hour and so I randomly asked the bot about his curse and that gave us the flag.

# Quence your thirst
This was another one of the challenges which took us a lot of time. At first we thought it was some kind of general encrypt like caeser cipher but we were so wrong.  
It was from the first look we understood `lds` this was decrypted to `the`. Even after this knowledge we started exploring different ciphers. when we understood we were wrong as none of the named ciphering was working we used the brute force method and started decrypting all of the 26 alphabets.But the problem arised when we discovered   
there were no word in the paragh containing `i,o,p,j` so we had to PnC through it .There were 24 total possibilities and we had to go through them all for the flag.

# Stairway to Heaven 
I just woke up and read the challenge and remembered that one of my friends was doing this challenge on the linux terminal.  
So I figured I somehow had to run the game on terminal and then see what happens . After a long time of doing everything I could to run the challenge on the terminal I gave up
and then one of my teammates managed to run it and then I just copied the colourful pattern and pasted it on the notepad just to see if there was something hidden in the text.
At first it kind of seemed pointless but then I saw the flag and was so reliefed that all my hard work did not go to waste.

# Nom Nom
This was another one of those levels we just had to inspect the website and search for something unusual. I swear this level was so annoying we thought of leaving the ctf so many times but we just did'nt.
We went to most random places and started changing most random things thinking it would do something .TBH to this day I still do not exactly know how we solved it but I just remember my part that was finding the cookies and changing admin value to true. As soon as we saw the pac moving and giving us the key we just felt so motivated to continue ctf.

# Heads up, tails down
In this challenge we were given a corrupted png file and we somehow had to make it visible. the first thought we had was to convert it into different kind of img files sumch ans jpeg , pdf and others.  
When this did not work we kind of took help from google and asked it how to read a corrupted png file and it told us to use a hexedit site to correct the file at the binary level. We got to know that a png file always starts with a specific PNG header (89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A). After correcting that we got the flag in a photo.
